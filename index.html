                    I went to elementary school at <span class="highlight">Del Mar Heights</span> and middle school at <span class="highlight">Earl Warren</span>. Of course, I am now attending <a href="https://cc.sduhsd.net/" target="_blank">Canyon Crest Academy</a>, and I feel that it is a great fit for me. For my whole life, mathematics has come very easy to me, and I find it very interesting. In the last few years, theoretical physics has also fascinated me. This year, I am taking many classes which continue to challenge and intrigue me, including physics, computer science, and calculus classes. I plan to go to college to earn a PhD in some kind of <span class="highlight">particle physics</span>.

                    Outside of school, I love to spend time at the gym. I started going a little over a year ago to <a href="https://www.crunch.com/locations/carmel-valley" target="_blank">Crunch</a> at The Village at Pacific Highlands Ranch. Recently, my friends and I have also enjoyed going to <span class="highlight">Mesa Rim</span>, a rock climbing and bouldering gym. For years, I have spent much time <span class="highlight">riding bikes</span>, including mountain, electric, and dirt bikes. I spend most of my time on bikes either on jump trails or on the road wheelieing. When at home, I often play video games such as Call of Duty or skate.

                    Since the beginning of seventh grade I have been a member of <span class="highlight">Teen Volunteers in Action</span>, through which I participate in many volunteering events. This includes food drives, beach cleanups, assisting the disabled, and much more. Through CCA, I am participating in the quantum physics club, rock climbing club, Best Seeds, and <span class="highlight">DECA</span> this year. I have maintained my first job at <a href="https://bongiornospizza.net/" target="_blank">Bongiorno's New York Pizzeria</a> in Solana Beach since the beginning of this summer. I am currently in the process of securing an internship involving the research and refinement of new high definition imaging technology.
